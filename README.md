**A proactive, AI-driven digital immune system that learns your system's behavior to detect and neutralize novel threats in real-time.**

## üöÄ About The Project

Traditional cybersecurity is reactive. It relies on signatures of *known* threats, meaning we are always one step behind the attackers. **Project Aegis** was born from a different philosophy: what if we could build a security system that functions like a biological immune system?

> Instead of just looking for known malware, Aegis creates a dynamic baseline of your system's "healthy" behavior‚Äîits normal processes, network connections, and file interactions. It then uses this baseline to spot anomalous patterns symptomatic of a brand-new, never-before-seen attack.

This tool is not just a script; it's a complete platform. It combines a lightweight Python agent (`watchdog.py`) with a powerful Flask backend and a sleek, real-time web dashboard. It‚Äôs a modern security tool for the modern threat landscape, designed for analysts, developers, and security enthusiasts who want to see the future of defense.

### ‚ú® Core Features

* **üß† AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** At its core, Aegis uses a heuristic and eventually an AI-driven engine to score the "suspicion level" of system events, moving beyond simple rule-based alerts.
* **üëÅÔ∏è Real-time Process Monitoring:** Captures every new process, its parent, its command line arguments, and its digital signature status the moment it executes.
* **üåê Live Web Dashboard:** A beautiful and intuitive command center built with Flask and Socket.IO that displays system events and security alerts as they happen.
* **üîç Deep System Intelligence:** Automatically performs hash calculations (SHA256), checks file signatures, and integrates with the **VirusTotal API** to enrich data.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Heuristic Scoring Engine:** Generates a "Suspicion Score" based on a combination of factors (unsigned files, suspicious parent processes, running from temp folders) for intelligent alerting.
* ** scalable Foundation:** Built with a **SQLite database** backend to professionally log and manage thousands of events for historical analysis and future model training.
* **üîß Clean & Modular Codebase:** Logically structured to make it incredibly easy for others to contribute new detection modules and features.

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Get your local copy of Project Aegis up and running in a few simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.9+** and **pip** must be installed.
* **Git** for cloning the repository.
* A free **VirusTotal API Key** is required for full functionality.

#### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AegisProject.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AegisProject.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory**
    ```sh
    cd AegisProject
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure API Key**
    * Open the `app.py` file and find the line `VT_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`.
    * Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual VirusTotal API key.
5.  **Initialize the Database**
    * The database (`aegis.db`) will be created automatically on the first run.
6.  **Launch the Aegis Server!**
    * You must run the server with administrator/sudo privileges to allow it to monitor all system processes.
    * **On Windows:** Open your terminal (CMD or PowerShell) as an Administrator.
    * **On macOS/Linux:** Use the `sudo` command.
    ```sh
    # On macOS/Linux
    sudo python app.py

    # On Windows (in an Admin terminal)
    python app.py
    ```

### üìñ How to Use

Once the server is running, the system is active.

1.  **Open the Command Center**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
    * You will see the live dashboard, which will immediately start displaying new process events from your machine.

2.  **Monitor for Alerts**
    * Use your computer normally. As new programs run, they will appear on the dashboard.
    * The system will automatically analyze each event. Suspicious events will be highlighted with a **"WARNING"** or **"CRITICAL"** status and a non-zero suspicion score.

3.  **Explore the Data**
    * The `explore_data.py` script can be run to get a quick summary of all events logged in the database.
    ```sh
    python explore_data.py
    ```
